  I'm starting a blog. Mediocre data takes to come.

My name is Bristow. I studied political science in undergrad. I did what many college students do, which is to put "proficient in Microsoft Excel" on my resume despite that statement being a lie. I didn't think that would really be relevant in the long run. I was wrong!

I accidentally started a career in data analytics by taking an Americorps VISTA position with Habitat for Humanity International in Atlanta. I worked data jobs with Atlanta nonprofits for two years. I self-taught a lot of R and SQL. Here's my obligatory iris graphic, by the way.

With a stagnant job market and nothing but free time on my hands in late 2020, I applied to graduate programs and started studying at Carnegie Mellon University for a Master of Science Public Policy and Management. There, I've continued to learn a lot about R, Python, SQL, visualization tools, dashboard software, and data mining approaches. 

I hope to use this space to share things I'm trying to learn, my appreciation of R, and my love-hate relationship with Excel. Cheers!
