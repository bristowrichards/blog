Of course, there are so many factors that affect those two inputs (construction supply, labor costs, and mortgage rates, to name a few). While the price of homes can me measured through valuations and transactions, the price of the land itself is harder to grasp.\n\n## Background\n\nA team of researchers associated with Rutgers, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have attempted to measure variations in home price over the years to capture\n\n[link](https://www.aei.org/housing/land-price-indicators/)\n\n# Loading the data\n\nThe data download is a large Microsoft Excel file with sheets that measure different geographies, from national aggregates down to the census tract level. I will start with ZIP codes because the census tract data is sparse, with many tracts missing data entirely. Tracts are small! While I load the data, I'll rename some complicated column names, and change one column from text to boolean.\n\n```{r}\nxl = \"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AEI_adjusted-Land-Data-2020-1.xlsx?x91208\"\nzip_codes = openxlsx::read.xlsx( # using \n    xl, \n    sheet=5, # zip code sheet \n    cols = 1:7 # ignore note\n  ) %>% # I love R pipes :)\n  rename(\n    Land.Value = \"Land.Value.(Per.Acre,.As-Is)\",\n    Std.Land.Value = \"Land.Value.(1/4.Acre.Lot,.Standardized)\",\n    Land.Percent = \"Land.Share.of.Property.Value\",\n    HPA = \"Home.Price.Appreciation.(HPA)\",\n    Imputed = \"Land.Share.Imputed?\"\n  ) %>%\n  mutate( # this might not save much memory but feels appropriate\n    Imputed = ifelse(Imputed == \"Y\", TRUE, FALSE)\n  )\n\nsummary(zip_codes)\n```\n\nThis is a lot of information that I'd like to investigate, but I don't have any background on real estate economics. For now, I'd like visualize all the place I call home *(it would be a bad idea to post my address on the internet, right?)*. Lets look at ZIP code `15217`.\n\n```{r}\nzip_codes %>%\n  filter(ZIP.Code == \"15217\") %>% \n  ggplot(data=., aes(x=Year)) +\n  geom_col(aes(y=Std.Land.Value), fill=\"#299c5e\") +\n  labs(y = \"Standardized Land Value\",\n       title = \"Land Price Appreciation in the ZIP code 15217\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2012:2020) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=Land.Percent*3e5), size=1.5, color=\"red\", group=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~./3e5, name = \"Land Share of Value\")) +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n```{r}\n# cbsa = read.xlsx(\"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AEI_adjusted-Land-Data-2020-1.xlsx?x91208\",sheet=3)\n```\n\n```{r}\nstate = openxlsx::read.xlsx(\"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AEI_adjusted-Land-Data-2020-1.xlsx?x91208\",sheet=2)\n```\n\n```{r}\n\nggplot(data = state) +  \n  geom_line(\n    aes(x = Year,\n        y = Land.Share.of.Property.Value,\n        color = State)\n  )\n\n\n```\n\nMore reading at Joey Politano's blog [here](https://www.apricitas.io/p/americas-fractured-housing-market).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":8,"fig-height":4,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"message":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"lux","title-block-banner":true,"license":"CC BY","toc-title":"Table of contents","toc-location":"left","author":[{"name":"Bristow Richards","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bristow-richards/"}],"title":"Can we measure the price of land?","subtitle":"Exploring AEI's Land Price Indicator experimental data\n","date":"2022-11-18","image":"output/diagram.png","categories":["data"],"draft":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
