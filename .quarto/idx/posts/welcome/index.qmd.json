I did what many college students do, which is to put \"proficient in Microsoft Excel\" on my resume despite that statement being a lie. I didn't think that would really be relevant in the long run. I was wrong!\n\nI accidentally started a career in data analytics by taking an Americorps VISTA position with Habitat for Humanity International in Atlanta. I worked data jobs with Atlanta nonprofits for two years. I self-taught a lot of R and SQL. Here's my obligatory iris graphic, by the way.\n\n![](iris_data.png \"I made this using sample code from the iris data Wikipedia page. You can try it yourself!\")\n\nWith a stagnant job market and nothing but free time on my hands in late 2020, I applied to graduate programs and started studying at Carnegie Mellon University for a Master of Science Public Policy and Management. There, I've continued to learn a lot about R, Python, SQL, visualization tools, dashboard software, and data mining approaches. \n\nI hope to use this space to share things I'm trying to learn, my appreciation of R, and my love-hate relationship with Excel.
